# Ola-Booking-Data-Analytics-Power-BI-Project
The objective of this project is to analyze Ola‚Äôs revenue and operational data for July 2024 to:

‚û§ Understand payment method preferences and their impact on total revenue.

‚û§ Identify high-value customers and analyze their contribution.

‚û§ Examine daily ride distances to track demand consistency.

‚û§ Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize payment strategies and customer engagement.

This analysis aims to uncover actionable business insights to improve financial performance and enhance operational efficiency.

<h2>üìä Ride Volume Breakdown by Status</h2>

‚úÖ <strong>Successful Bookings:</strong> 63.97K rides were completed successfully, representing ~62.09% of total bookings.

‚ùå <strong>Cancellations:</strong>

Canceled by Customer: 18.43K (~17.89%)

Canceled by Driver: 10.5K (~10.19%)

Driver Not Found: 10.12K (~9.83%)</br></br>

‚û§ <strong>Insight:</strong> Around 38% of the bookings failed due to either cancellations or driver unavailability. This is a significant number that impacts both customer experience and business revenue.

<h3>üß† Actionable Insights:</h3>
‚û§ High Cancellation Rate: Over 1 in 3 rides are unsuccessful ‚Äì efforts should focus on reducing both driver and customer cancellations.</br></br>

‚û§ Driver Allocation Issue: ~10% of rides show "Driver Not Found" ‚Äî this suggests inefficiencies in fleet management or driver availability.

‚û§ Revenue Opportunity: Improving the success rate could significantly increase revenue beyond the current ‚Çπ35M monthly value.</br></br></br></br>

<h2>üìä Booking Overview:</h2>
Total Bookings: 1,03,024 </br></br>

Successful Bookings: 63,967

Cancelled Bookings: 28,933

Cancellation Rate: ~28.08%</br></br>

‚û§ <strong>Insight:</strong> Nearly 1 in every 4 rides was cancelled ‚Äî a significant loss of revenue and customer trust. Root causes must be identified and resolved to reduce churn.</br></br></br></br>

<h2>‚úÖ Key Insights:</h2>
Cash (‚âà50%) dominates Ola‚Äôs revenue collection.

UPI (‚âà38%) follows, showing strong digital adoption.

‚û§ Card payments are underutilized (<10% combined), suggesting opportunity for incentivization (e.g., cashback or discounts) to promote non-cash methods.

‚û§ Top 5 customers alone contributed ~‚Çπ32.6K, indicating a small but high-value customer segment. These users may benefit from premium loyalty programs, referral incentives, or targeted offers to retain and expand spending. </br></br></br></br>
